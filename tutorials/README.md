# Tutorials

In this folder you can find a collection of useful tutorials in order to understand the principles and the potential of **EZyRB**.

#### [Tutorial 1](tutorial-1.ipynb)
Here we show the typical workflow on a vtk pressure field for:
1. The construcion of the reduced basis space, called offline phase;
2. The online evaluation of the output of interest.


#### More to come...
We plan to add more tutorials but the time is often against us. If you want to contribute with a notebook on a feature not covered yet we will be very happy and give you support on editing!
